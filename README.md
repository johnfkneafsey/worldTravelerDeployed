If you've ever traveled abroad, you've probably found yourself asking questions like these. In many cases, there are English speakers who can assist you.  However, sometimes that isn't an option. That's where World Traveler comes in! NEEDS WORK   

## How It Works
Upon logging in, you will be presented with your own unique Dashboard. Here, you can select which language you are interested in learning.  In addition, you can view your learning progress for all 7 languages.

After selecting a language from the dropdown, you are presented with your first exercise. Read the sentence and provide the associated english translation. Or, you can choose to "Flip" the card and read the sentence in english and provide the foreign translation.

## Progress Tracking
World Traveler uses an algorithm-based system to track your progress and enhance your learning experience. Questions that you answer correctly are less likely to appear in the deck.  On the other hand, questions that are answered incorrectly are more likely to surface up until you provide the correct answer. 

World Traveler simplifies these mechanics for the user by providing a "Mastery" percentage rating on the Dashboard.  A "Mastery" rating of 100% indicates that the user is sufficiently skilled in the given language

At any time, you can come back and add/delete/edit expenses, define new categories and create new budgets.  Furthermore, Easy Budget provides a variety of summary tools that allow you to track and compare your expenses across categories and over time.
